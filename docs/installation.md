## Installation and Requirements
---
Here's what you'll need:
- Windows/MacOS system (Linux will need to run source code, see [readme](https://github.com/nalvarez508/amtrak-rail-planner/blob/master/README.md))
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (just needs to be installed on the computer)

Download the OS-specific zipfile from the Releases page, it's packaged inside. Store the executable wherever is convenient and launch it. If there are issues with launching it, please create an issue and I can try to investigate.
