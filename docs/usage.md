This is where most work will be done in the app.
### Stations
Origin and destination lists are presented on the left and right. Every *train* station in Amtrak's network is listed here. To search, type something in the box and hit enter. The Swap button will flip the origin and destination locations.

### Date selection
Click on "Select Departure Date" or the currently listed date to open the calendar selection area. Selecting a date will close the calendar. Alternatively, click either of the two aforementioned buttons to close the calendar. You may increment the date by one with the plus and minus buttons.

### Finding trains
Click "Find Trains" to initiate a search. A progress bar will appear, and the status bar at the bottom of the window will reflect the current action.

### Viewing results
Once a search is successful, all results will be displayed in the table below the current search header. Selecting a specific train will enable the "Save Segment" button, which, when clicked, will save that train to your itinerary.
