## Overview

*Love taking Amtrak?*
*Bought a Rail Pass?*
*Having trouble creating an itinerary?*

Look no further than the Amtrak Rail Planner. Built because I was in that very situation, it performs the legwork of searching for you and compiles all the trains in one, neat table. Specific train segments can be saved to your itinerary, which will be exported to a spreadsheet once you're happy with the trip.

### Abstract

Traveling by train with a Rail Pass is a cost-efficient way to see the country in one month but planning the trip can be a time-consuming process. The Amtrak Rail Pass Assistant will provide travelers an easy way to plan their ten-segment journey to any of the destinations served by train in the United States. Manual work of searching the Amtrak website and inputting information into a spreadsheet will be eliminated. The Python application provides an efficient and easy way to create a travel itinerary which can be exported later. Novel features include full results in one list instead of pages, details of each train in the resulting spreadsheet, and pictures of each selected city in the search.
