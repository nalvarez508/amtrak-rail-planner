Look no further than the Amtrak Rail Planner. Built because I was in that very situation, it performs the legwork of searching for you and compiles all the trains in one, neat table. Specific train segments can be saved to your itinerary, which will be exported to a spreadsheet once you're happy with the trip.

### Abstract

Traveling by train with a Rail Pass is a cost-efficient way to see the country in one month but planning the trip can be a time-consuming process. The Amtrak Rail Pass Assistant will provide travelers an easy way to plan their ten-segment journey to any of the destinations served by train in the United States. Manual work of searching the Amtrak website and inputting information into a spreadsheet will be eliminated. The Python application provides an efficient and easy way to create a travel itinerary which can be exported later. Novel features include full results in one list instead of pages, details of each train in the resulting spreadsheet, and pictures of each selected city in the search.

### License
Licensed under GNU General Public License v3. Read it - sure - but here's what I want you to take away: If you want to package it with something, credit the project and include the source, as mentioned. You want to improve it? Awesome, create a pull request so we can all benefit.

Basically, it's a side project, but it's still my work.

### Issues with App
If there are problems with running the application, please submit an issue. I cannot test for everything but tried to make it as resilient as possible during normal use.

### Future Work
Lots of you have reached out with suggestions for the application. That's great!  
However, I cannot necessarily implement them all, as much as I would love to. This may be due to a technical roadblock, infeasability, or lack of public interest. I'm still a college student with other things to keep up on, and this was always a side project for me.

With that being said, here are some suggestions I've received.
- Accessible timetables for each route
- App schedules with layovers/connections in mind
- Train filtering during search
- Note-taking area for each train in itinerary window
- Map displaying markers for origin/destination and route
- Station info
  - Attractions in destination cities
  - Places to eat
  - Availability of parking
  - Transit connections/routes served
  - Hotels
  - In-station amenities
  - Distance to final location
- Train info
  - Number and names of stops along a route
  - Amenities on-board
  - On-time performance, or if prone to delays
